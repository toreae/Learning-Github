Learning-Github
===============

Where I experiment and learn how to use Github as a management tool. 

This is my experiment. Thanky you :) 

My next experiment is:
- [X] make a develop branch
- [X] make chances to the develop branch
- [ ] add a feature branch
- [ ] make changes to the feature branch
- [ ] merge the feature brach into the develop branch
- [ ] merge the develop branch into the master branch, with a release number tag.

Sounds simple? not to me ;)
